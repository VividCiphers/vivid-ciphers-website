        <p><strong class='extra-bold t-green'>Technology</strong> evolves at a dizzying pace and keeping up with the latest and greatest trends can be an overwhelming task. 
           At Vivid Ciphers, we're learners.  We're a community formed on the ideal that learning isn't a means to an end, rather the goal to strive for.
           This idealogy is shared amongst all of our community members, and is the foundation that our entire team is built upon.
